        <string name="ecclesiaDifferentQ">What makes E-cclesia different/better than other voting systems?</string>
        <string name="ecclesiaDifferentA">E-cclesia is the only currently available fully decentralised voting system. For a voting system to be decentralised, this means that everyone involved in the election can take part in counting the votes. This is more secure than centralised voting systems that depend on one party to count all the votes because it is secure against corruption and counting errors. E-cclesia also satisfies more security properties than other available voting systems. </string>

        <string name="whyRegisteredQ">Why do I have to be registered to an organisation to join in an election? </string>
        <string name="whyRegisteredA">To ensure that only eligible voters can vote in a specific election, the app needs tosystem generates unique encrypted credentials for these voterseach voter. These credentials can only be generated and stored once a user has registered with the organisation. </string>
        <string name="abstainQ">Can I abstain from voting? </string>
        <string name="abstainA">Yes. If you have already registered for the election and not cast a vote, you can still see the results without voting.</string>
        <string name="joinAfterQ">Can I join elections after the vote casting period has started? </string>
        <string name="joinAfterA">No. To satisfy the security properties of E-cclesia, only people who have joined the election before the casting period starts can cast a vote. </string>
        <string name="voteAgainQ">Can I vote again?</string>
        <string name="voteAgainA">No. As your vote will begin the process of being recorded to the blockchain once you have casted your vote, it is not possible to recast a vote. </string>
        <string name="howLongQ">How long does it take to verify that my vote has been recorded?</string>
        <string name="howLongA">There is no average time for this process, but there are estimated lower boundaries and upper boundaries. Usually, this process can take anywhere between 5 minutes and 4 hours.</string>
        <string name="howVerifyQ">How do I verify that my vote has been recorded?</string>
        <string name="howVerifyA">When you open the election you voted for, the application will automatically run the required steps to verify this behind the scenes. There is nothing voters need to do manually other than checking the app frequently after casting their vote so you can check the result of the verification. It is important to verify that your vote has been recorded on the chance that it has not been recorded. There are no extra steps you required other than need to take to verify this. </string>
        <string name="ifVoteProblemQ">What happens if my vote has not been recorded? </string>
        <string name="ifVoteProblemA">On the chance that your vote could not be verified as recorded, then you are allowed to recast your vote. This will be immediately detected by the application, and you should be able to recast your vote as long as the casting period has not ended yet. You are also highly recommended to report this error to us to record the number of similar errors occurred and take action. </string>
    <string name="whyVoteProblemQ">Why would my vote not be recorded? </string>
    <string name="whyVoteProblemA">Once a vote has been casted it is stored on a server before being sent to be recorded to the blockchain at which point it is guaranteed to be part of the final result of votes for the election. Occasionally a communication error or malicious  attack between the application to the server or the server to the blockchain can occur, preventing this from happening. </string>
